## Summary ##

GwtAI provides easy to use cross-browser [Java Applets](http://java.sun.com/applets/) integration to [Google Web Toolkit (GWT)](http://code.google.com/webtoolkit/) projects. GwtAI contains a number of utilities and helper classes, such as automatic creation of a wrapper widget and mechanism to communicate with [Java Applets](http://java.sun.com/applets/).

## Working examples ##

GwtAI's showcase project is the integration of an icon into the system tray bar using an [Java Applets](http://java.sun.com/applets/) to go beyond what [GWT](http://code.google.com/webtoolkit/) is capable itself by reaching outside of the browser into the user's desktop.

Check out the [showcase page](http://gwtai.traceurl.com/GwtAI.html). The example source is available from SVN in a separate [demo project (/trunk/gwtaidemo)](http://code.google.com/p/gwtai/source/browse/#svn/trunk/gwtaidemo).

A second example demonstrates how to integrate a [JavaFX](http://www.sun.com/software/javafx/) program into a [GWT](http://code.google.com/webtoolkit/) application. Using GwtAI this only takes a couple of lines of code...

Don't miss the [JavaFX demo](http://gwtai.traceurl.com/gwtaifx/JavaFXDemo.html)! The source is available from SVN under a [separate project (/trunk/gwtaifx)](http://code.google.com/p/gwtai/source/browse/#svn/trunk/gwtaifx).

## Current state ##

GwtAI is not yet fit for use in production. The project is in a _Proof of Concept_ like state. Feel free to take and use the code, but don't expect it to be stable. In case you have a question, please look at the [FAQ](http://code.google.com/p/gwtai/wiki/FAQ).
