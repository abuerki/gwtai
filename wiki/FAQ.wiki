== I run the GWT Shell and get a dialog that says _Java(TM) Plug-in Fatal Error_ ==

Alas the GWT Shell can not handle embedded things like Flash or Applets. There is some restriction in the SWT component used to run a browser inside of the Shell application. To test your application you have to compile the code and run it in a browser.

For more information see the [http://code.google.com/p/google-web-toolkit/issues/detail?id=283 GWT issue 283].

== The GWT !Java2JavaScript compiler says _No source code is available for type javax.swing.JApplet_ ==

You have your applet implementation class within you _client_ package, that does not work. You have to put the applet class into the _server package_, or in a package of its own.

== I don't want my GWT application to include the Applet source code ==

During compilation the GWT !Java2JavaScript compiler needs to see the actual Applet implementation. But the respective annotation is compile time only. The GWT compiler only translates the files in the _client_ package. So decoupling works by placing the classes into different packages. Once you compiled your project the GWT compiler output won't contain any Applet classes.


== I have problems compiling, the GWT compiler throws a !StackOverflowError ==

On Linux please make sure you use a 32bit JDK, even on a 64bit platform you have to fall
back on a 32bit JDK. This is not a GwtAI but a GWT problem. See the [http://groups.google.com/group/Google-Web-Toolkit/search?group=Google-Web-Toolkit&q=64-bit+linux&qt_g=Search+this+group GWT Google Groups] for more information on that one.

The {{{java.lang.StackOverflowError}}} seems to occure only on a 1.6 JDK version, so try using a 1.5 JDK to compile things. With JDK 1.6 you can try to increase the heap size with some JVM arguments (e.g. {{{-XX:PermSize=64M}}} and {{{-XX:MaxPermSize=256M}}}). Although the heap size increase is not guaranteed to work...
