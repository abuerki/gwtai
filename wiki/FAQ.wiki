== I run the GWT Shell and get a dialog that says _Java(TM) Plug-in Fatal Error_ ==

Alas the GWT Shell can not handle embedded things like Flash or Applets. There is some restriction in the SWT component used to run a browser inside of the Shell application. To test your application you have to compile the code and run it in a browser.

For more information see the [http://code.google.com/p/google-web-toolkit/issues/detail?id=283 GWT issue 283].

== The GWT !Java2JavaScript compiler says _No source code is available for type javax.swing.JApplet_ ==

You have your applet implementation class within you _client_ package, that does not work. You have to put the applet class into the _server package_, or in a package of its own.

== I don't want my GWT application to include the Applet source code ==

During compilation the GWT !Java2JavaScript compiler needs to see the actual Applet implementation. But the respective annotation is compile time only. The GWT compiler only translates the files in the _client_ package. So decoupling works by placing the classes into different packages. Once you compiled your project the GWT compiler output won't contain any Applet classe.
