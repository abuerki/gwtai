#summary Describes how to use the new branch 0.4.1

= Introduction =

The new branch introduces some new stuff:
  * Maven build process
  * GWT-RPC communication with applet allowing full object graph.

But because of the new build process you might want some insight into using it. Read on! :)

= Prerequisites =

Your development environment needs to support maven and preferably have some GWT support to make your life easier.

  * Netbeans: Supports maven but you wanna [http://netbeans.org/kb/docs/web/quickstart-webapps-gwt.html install GWT4NB]. 
  * Eclipse: You need to [http://m2eclipse.sonatype.org/installing-m2eclipse.html install m2clipse] for maven support and the [http://code.google.com/intl/da/eclipse/docs/getting_started.html Google Eclipse Plugin] for som GWT support.

= Opening the project =
When you have [http://code.google.com/p/gwtai/source/checkout checked out the code] you open the outer/parent project 'gwtai'. The subfolders, gwtaicore, gwtaiclient and gwtaidemo are all subproject to the parent project which you can open as modules inside you IDE.
